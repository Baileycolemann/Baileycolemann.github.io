				<h2 class="heading">About me</h2>
				<p>My name is Bailey Coleman and I am from Greenville, South Carolina. I am a senior at the University of South Carolina and will be graduating in May 2023. My major is biology with a minor in chemistry. I participate in two women dominate clubs as well as do undergraduate research in the Dudyka lab.</p>
				<p id="expand" class="visible">Outside of school, I enjoy painting, cooking, watching TV, going out with friends, and shopping. I also enjoy music a lot. Some of my favorite generas of music are hip-hop, r and b, and indie. Something like listening to music and painting with friends would be my idea of a fun day.</p>

				<h2 class="heading">My Future Career Plans</h2>
				<p>Picking a career has been very hard for me. There are a lot of routes you can go with my major and I have changed my mind a lot. Originally, I was on the route to go to dental school. After careful deliberation, I decided that another four years of school was not for me. Since dropping that plan, I have cycled through possible options for my future.</p>
				<p id="expand-p" class="visible">One other possibility is graduate school, but I don't plan on doing that directly out of undergraduate. As of right now, my plan is to move back to my hometown for a couple of  years and work an entry level job. Hopefully through this experience and time I can decifer but I want in a career as well as pay off some of my loans before jumping into more schooling.</p>
